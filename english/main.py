        These steps should give you a good idea about how to build your clean-up and pre-processing strategies. 
        After these pre-processing steps, the corpus of text is ready for NLP algorithms such as Word2Vec, GloVe etc. These pre-processing steps will definitely improve the modelâ€™s accuracy.
